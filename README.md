# NFT Marketpalce Solidity/Truffle Project

This project aims to demonstrate intermediate smart contract architecture complete with interfaces, libraries. As this is a WIP demo, contracts are semi-compliant with ERC721 token standards, with additional functionally to be added in the case of production. This project is free to be used as boilerplate for anyone looking to get started on an NFT marketplace of their own.

All contracts, libraries, and interfaces were written from scratch.

## What's Inside?

### Interfaces

-   IERC165
-   IERC721
-   IERC721Enumerable
-   IERC721Metadata

### Libraries

-   Counters
-   SafeMath

### Contracts

-   ERC165
-   ERC721
-   ERC721Connector
-   ERC721Enumerable
-   ERC721Metadata
-   SpaceMonkez.sol (nft name and symbol placeholder)
-   Relevant test and deployment scripts

## What's not Inside?

-   Artwork. There are no images or artwork to be found here. But do feel free to play around with this if you have some of your own. Shouldn't be too hard to add it to the folder structure.
